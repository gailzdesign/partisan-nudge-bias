This can be viewed as a seed change in how the U.S. views individual rights and privacy.  While I am greatly supportive of assisting low-income individuals with basics, I am also very supportive of individuals' rights to privacy...this proposal is a step towards making decisions for and about people.  For some populations this may be helpful because they may not be capable to assist themselves to the extent possible.  However for others, it is imposing or inadvertently ""labeling"" someone when they have not self-identified themselves as such.  Even by opting-out, they still have been ""identified""...or targeted if looked at for darker purposes.  History is full of examples of good intentions being executed in awful ways.
