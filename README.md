Folders correspond to all experiments reported in the paper. Each folder contains: (1) a "raw" data file (`.csv` files); and (2) STATA do-files that prepare/clean the raw data file, and an analysis script that executes all analyses reported in the paper (`.do` files).

*Note:* In Study 4 we surveyed a sample of US mayors, and asked them to report the approximate number of constituents they represent. We have removed data on reported consistuency size in order to protect participant anonymity, as this information can be used to identify individual participants.
